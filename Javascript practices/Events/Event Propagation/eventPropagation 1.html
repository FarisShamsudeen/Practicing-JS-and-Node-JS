<!-- 
Event Delegation

Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element instead of to each individual child element. When the event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent, triggering the event listener. This can improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.

Are they the same or related?

Event propagation and event delegation are related concepts. Event delegation relies on event propagation to work. When an event occurs on a child element, it propagates up to the parent, where the delegated event listener is attached. -->
